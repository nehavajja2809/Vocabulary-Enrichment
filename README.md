# Vocabulary-Enrichment
Project report for Vocabulary Enrichment

This Python script displays a "Word of the Day" notification on your Windows desktop, helping you build your vocabulary in a fun and consistent way.

ðŸ“Œ Features
i. Automatically picks words based on today's date
ii. Selects a random word that starts with the daily letter
iii. Fetches words and meanings from a local JSON dictionary
iv. Displays a beautiful Windows toast notification every 15 seconds
v. Includes a notification sound and optional icon (wod.png)

 How It Works:-
-> The day of the month (1â€“31) maps to a letter (1 â†’ a, 2 â†’ b, ..., 26 â†’ z, wraps around for 27â€“31).
-> A .json file (dictionary.json) contains words and their meanings.
-> From all words starting with the selected letter, one is randomly picked and shown via the winotify library.
-> A loop sends this notification every 15 seconds (for demo purposes; can be changed).
